2>
if we need to see the transactions of a particular bank then query must be like
SELECT DbtrAgt, COUNT(*) As transactions, SUM(IntrBkSttlmAmt) AS total_amount
FROM Transaction_Pacs8_Outwards
where DbtrAgt like 'ABNK%'
GROUP BY DbtrAgt
order by DbtrAgt;

extra examples
ABNK% can be replaced with BBNK%, CBNK% etc

INWARD
3>This query is for inwards to those bank  branches
SELECT CdtrAgt, COUNT(*) As transactions, SUM(IntrBkSttlmAmt) AS total_amount
FROM Transaction_Pacs8_Inwards
GROUP BY CdtrAgt
order by CdtrAgt;

4>for particular bank branch inwards this is query
SELECT CdtrAgt, COUNT(*) As transactions, SUM(IntrBkSttlmAmt) AS total_amount
FROM Transaction_Pacs8_Inwards
where CdtrAgt like 'ABNK%'
GROUP BY CdtrAgt
order by CdtrAgt;
